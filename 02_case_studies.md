	<h3 class="major"> Indigenous data</h3>
    <p> Local Contexts <a href="www.localcontexts.org">(www.localcontexts.org)</a> supports the application of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Biocultural (BC) Labels to datasets to ensure information relating to provenance and cultural authority is maintained in the digital records associated with mƒÅtauranga and taonga. Maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of this metadata in Te Ao Matihiko (Digital World) is a key challenge which the Veracity Lab is helping us address.</p>

	<h3 class="major"> Natural products </h3>
    <p> We will be exploring with the organic community in Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally how we can take a 40 year old internationally recognised environmental standard process from analogue to digital using veracity. This is of particular interest to Aotearoa New Zealand as we are in the midst of creating regulating organic through our Organic Products Bill. </p>

	<h3 class="major"> Contestable AI</h3>
    <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) will undoubtedly enter more and more areas 
of people's daily lives. From loan and insurance claim decision to 
autonomous machines in farming, AI is already in use in many areas 
today. An important question is, how do humans intervene when they 
disagree with or doubt the actions that are triggered by AI? How do we 
make sure actions of AI are reliably documented and understandable? Who 
is accountable? Veracity Lab is looking at these questions from the 
perspective of the national digital infrastructure needed to ensure 
humans can live well alongside an ever increasing amount of AI in their 
environment.</p>
