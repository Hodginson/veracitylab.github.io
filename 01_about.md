	<h3 class="major">Vision</h3>
    <p> Our vision is to create a <strong>high veracity digital nation</strong> reflects and amplifies a desired quality of life here in Aotearoa New Zealand </p>

	<h3 class="major">Purpose</h3>
    <p> Veracity Lab provides independent research and outcomes to complement and feed into commercially driven research. We intend to be the Aotearoa equivalent of the Turing Institute and Ada Lovelace Institute.  </p>

	<h3 class="major">Research Streams</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> <b><u>Conceptual and regulatory stream </u></b>: elicit knowledge from stakeholders about what a formal model of veracity may look like; explore suitable logical paradigms to represent and deal with trust, engage in rigorous critique, inconsistency in  assessments of veracity by different parties. This stream will include models, frameworks, guidance, and forecasting efforts focused on veracity threats and opportunities for Aotearoa New Zealand. </li>
		<li> <b><u>Computational stream</u></b>: to develop software and system design capacity for auditing decision making and determination of veracity; generalising the technical platforms over which the mechanics of regulatory systems can be represented. This stream will include reference implementations and delivery of high veracity products and services with partners.</li>
		<li> <b><u>Socio-technical stream </u></b>: to develop socio-technical capacity for contesting of activities and transactions within and between the systems of value exchange ecosystems, influenced by socio-cultural changes and shifting business patterns; develop crowdsourcing solutions (including suitable user interfaces and incentive mechanisms), deal with different velocity of the computational veracity auditing as opposed to crowdsourced audits. This stream will include reference implementations, socio-technical products and services with partners, governance models and interoperability frameworks to support a system of systems, including self-sovereign systems.</li>
		<li> <b><u>Integration stream</u></b>: outputs from the first three streams will be continuously integrated into a general purpose framework and reference implementation, to ensure reusability, extendability and repurpose-ability of all Veracity Lab outputs. </li>
