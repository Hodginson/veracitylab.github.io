<p>

​Veracity Lab is the first key deliverable and enabler for the “Veracity Technology Spearhead” research project. 
It is a joint initiative between Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Waikato, the University of Auckland, 
the University of Otago and the University of Canterbury, with its head office located at Victoria University of Wellington, 
and initially funded by the Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge (SfTI). 
Veracity Lab has been established to explore, research, co-design and co-develop high veracity approaches to key areas of 
digital infrastructure needed for a digital nation, including the requisite digital equivalents to traditional public 
infrastructure.
