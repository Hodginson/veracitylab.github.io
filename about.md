Our vision is to create a <strong>high veracity digital nation</strong> that is based on and amplifies the human values and quality of life here in Aotearoa New Zealand

Veracity Lab has been designed as an objective, cross-university and cross-sector entity to sit between government, citizens, businesses and communities, to add academic and scientific rigor to the pressing questions of how we live well in a digital world.

<p>
Veracity Lab intends to be the Aotearoa equivalent of the Turing Institute and Ada Lovelace Institute, providing independent 
research and outcomes to complement and feed into commercially driven research. 
​Veracity Lab is the first key deliverable and enabler for the “Veracity Technology Spearhead” research project. 
It is a joint initiative between Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Waikato, the University of Auckland, 
the University of Otago and the University of Canterbury, with its head office located at Victoria University of Wellington, 
and initially funded by the Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge (SfTI). 
Veracity Lab has been established to explore, research, co-design and co-develop high veracity approaches to key areas of 
digital infrastructure needed for a digital nation, including the requisite digital equivalents to traditional public 
infrastructure.
